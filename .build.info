# This file contains details about how to
# perform a release of pygaps (mostly for me).

# Create new branch for release (we use git flow)
# Respect semantic versioning for the releases
git flow release start x.y.z

# Ensure all tests are passing
# or use Travis to run automatically
pytest --cov --cov-report xml:coverage.xml

# Run bumpversion to change any version strings
# scattered throughout the source code
bumpversion major/minor/patch

# Finish branch
git flow release finish x.y.z

# Push, including tags
git push --tags
