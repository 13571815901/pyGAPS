Units in pyGAPS
===============

When computers work with physical data, units are always a variable that inrtoduces confusion to the
human users. This page attempts to explain how pyGAPS handles units and other such real world concepts
such as relative pressure and mass or volume basis.

Units can be specified for the following properties:

    - Isotherm pressure: *bar*, *Pa*, *atm*, *mmHg*
    - Isotherm loadingL: *mol*, *mmol*, *ml*, *cm3 STP*
    - Adsorbent mass, if working on a mass basis: *g*, *kg*
    - Adsorbent volume, if working on a volume basis: *cm3*, *ml*, *dm3*, *l*, *m3*
